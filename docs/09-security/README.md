## Security Overview

MTK Care Help implements security best practices at multiple levels:

### Application Security
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **XSS Protection**: Content Security Policy (CSP) headers implemented
- **CSRF Protection**: Built-in Next.js CSRF protection
- **Secure Headers**: Security headers configured for production

### Data Protection
- **Client-side Storage**: No sensitive data stored in browser storage
- **API Security**: Rate limiting and input validation on all endpoints
- **Error Handling**: Sensitive information not exposed in error messages

### Infrastructure Security
- **HTTPS Only**: All communications encrypted in production
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive configuration stored securely
- **Dependencies**: Regular security updates and vulnerability scanning

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Never commit sensitive data** (API keys, passwords, etc.)
2. **Validate all inputs** on both client and server side
3. **Use environment variables** for configuration
4. **Keep dependencies updated** regularly
5. **Follow secure coding practices**

### For Deployment
1. **Use HTTPS** in production environments
2. **Configure security headers** (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
3. **Regular security updates** for all components
4. **Monitor for vulnerabilities** in dependencies
5. **Implement proper logging** and monitoring

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:
1. **Do not** create a public issue
2. Send details to: security@mtkcare.com
3. Include steps to reproduce the issue
4. Allow time for investigation and patching
